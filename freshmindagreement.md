##What is Fresh Mind programme

TLDR: Fresh Mind is thoroughly formally researched mind focused life transformation programme.

Fresh Mind programme is a uniquely blended programme comprising of coaching, talking therapy, advice and guidance, mentorship and best practice information enabling clients to create their optimal life. 

The programme is based on Integral Theory (a meta theory of everything) and is founded on best in class formal research in transpersonal psychology. 

This research includes: 

* 'Theory of multiple intelligences' by Howard Gardener
* 'Spiral Dynamics' by Beck and Cowan
* 'Power vs Force' by David Hawkins
* 'Efforless Mastery' by Kenny Werner 
* 'Ultimate Secrets of Total Self Confidence' by Dr. Robert Anthony
* and many other research works. 

Fresh Mind is a holistic programme intended to be done once and return life long results to all clients who complete the programme. 

It is not a certified programme, yet we run it more rigorously than most certified programmes. 

Everything in Fresh Mind is evidence based, rational, optimised and systematic, with thoroughly documented problems and outcomes for each client. 

##Who Fresh Mind programme is for

TLDR: Fresh Mind is you if you are open minded and willing to upgrade your life through self transformation.

Fresh Mind is for anyone who is looking to live an optimal life. 

Those people who want as much as possible out of life right now. 

Fresh Mind clients require to have two of these three characteristics: 

1. A dose of open mindedness 
2. A dose of willingness to improve their lives 
3. Be coachable and guidable to try new techniques for self transformation 

Our clients begin from all kinds of starting points in life.

Some are: 

1. Super successful and are now bored of it, wondering who they really are
2. Depressed for decades and now want to finally live a life of bliss
3. Looking for the next most logical and fruitful phase in their life
4. Lacking purpose, energy and will to continue forward stronger and better
5. Wondering why none of the programmes they invested in so far worked for them long term
6. Looking for life long results, rather than temporary gains that quickly fade out
