# Integral governance

## Integral values, principles and approaches

These are the values that govern Integral as a company. 

### 1. Integrity
Integrity simply means delivering on your word. Your word is your bond. What you say is what you do. If you promise something, you have to deliver on it. There are no excuses. If you cannot deliver something, you don't promise it in the first place. If there are complications with what you promised, you make those complications clear as soon as possible. If you need more time or effort to complete something, keep everyone updated about what's going on as early as possible. 

### 2. Leadership
Everyone is a leader at Integral. You are leading yourself first. You are also leading the project that you are working on. You are leading the activities that you are working on. You are in the role of a leader on some level. You own the responsibility for what you are working on. You are accountable and report on your progress on regular basis. Leadership means that you also need to listen to others and include their best opinions in your work.

### 3. Results 
Results are practical outputs of excellent work. Results can be shown, shared, exploited and integrated into other aspects of the company or our customers's companies. Examples of results are: functional and working software, artworks, well-tested design blueprints, amazing pitch decks, great illustrations, appealing content, etc. Results is what you will be evaluated on and valued for. 

### 4. Communication
We value truth over everything else in communication. Tell the truth at all times, no matter how harsh it might sound. Have justifications for what you are saying. Bring evidence along with you for why you are saying it. Be forthcoming with the truth. Be clear with the truth you're telling. Never lie! 

### 5. Inquisitiveness 
Question things that you're working on. Ask the question of "Why?" as often as needed. Why are we doing things this way? Why are we doing this? Why don't we do it this way? What if we tried this? Your inquisitiveness needs to be as practical as possible. We encourage you to try different approaches to the same problem. To find alternate solutions that may be better than what you initially might have tried. Always be inquisitive and never be afraid to to ask the question "Why?". Also, every day, have new questions about what you're doing and what the company is doing. Write those questions down. Bring them to the conversations you are having with your colleagues. 

### 6. Dutifulness 
You are always working on at least one project. It is up to you to keep that project moving forward. This is why you're getting paid. This is why you are working in this company. Your duty is to keep the project going. To ask for whatever you need in order to keep it moving: information, resource, tooling, insights, materials, content, knowledge, etc. Dutifulness means that you work on things regularly and continuously and in a diligent fashion. 

### 7. Fun
We are here as a team of friends and equals. Nobody is above anybody else, no matter what their role or position is. Everyone can and will contribute in their own way and to the best of their ability. As such, we are going to do that through having as much fun as possible. We are not 'working' as such. Intead, we are creating, innovating and evolving things that are boring, outdated, broken into things that are fun, exciting, modern, contemporary, evolutionary and (wherever we can) revolutionary. This is how we Redesign Humanity. The future of humanity is fun, not oppression and work and struggle. 

### 8. Family 
At Integral, we work like a functional family. We are all helping each other to have as much fun and be as results oriented as possible. Communicate greatly, have respect and appreciation for each other, be productive and lead forward in the best way possible. This is how great family should be. 

### 9. Quality
We create the highest quality work we possibly can in everything we do. Quality is more valued than quantity. We are always questioning how we can make something of higher quality than what we did previously. We are always looking to be the best in what we do. We get inspiration from the best we can find and then improve on it. 

### 10. Joy
We work with (en)joy(ment) in everything we do. We are not looking to work on things we don't want to do. Within this, we recognise that even those things we love to do have an element of less enjoyable part to them. We make those elements as enjoyable for ourselves as possible either through automation or applying mixture of the other values, principles and approaches.
