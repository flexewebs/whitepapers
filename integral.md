# Integral governance

## Integral values, principles and approaches

These are the values that govern Integral as a company. 

### 1. Integrity
Integrity simply means delivering on your word. Your word is your bond. What you say is what you do. If you promise something, you have to deliver on it. There are no excuses. If you cannot deliver something, you don't promise it in the first place. If there are complications with what you promised, you make those complications clear as soon as possible. If you need more time or effort to complete something, keep everyone updated about what's going on as early as possible. 

### 2. Leadership
Everyone is a leader at Integral. You are leading yourself first. You are also leading the project that you are helping create. You are leading the activities that you are helping create. You are in the role of a leader on some level. You own the responsibility for what you are creating. You are accountable and report on your progress on regular basis. Leadership means that you also need to listen to others and include their best opinions in your creative process.

### 3. Results 
Results are practical outputs of excellent creativity. Results can be shown, shared, exploited and integrated into other aspects of the company or our customers's companies. Examples of results are: functional software, artworks, well-tested design blueprints, amazing pitch decks, great illustrations, appealing content, etc. Results is what you will be evaluated on and valued for. 

### 4. Communication
We value truth over everything else in communication. Tell the truth at all times, no matter how harsh it might sound. Have justifications for what you are saying. Bring evidence along with you for why you are saying it. Be forthcoming with the truth. Be clear with the truth you're telling. Never lie! 

### 5. Inquisitiveness 
Question things that you are creating. Ask the question of "Why?" as often as needed. Why are we doing things this way? Why are we doing this? Why don't we do it this way? What if we tried this? Your inquisitiveness needs to be as practical as possible. We encourage you to try different approaches to the same problem. To find alternate solutions that may be better than what you initially might have tried. Always be inquisitive and never be afraid to to ask the question "Why?". Also, every day, have new questions about what you're doing and what the company is doing. Write those questions down. Bring them to the conversations you are having with your colleagues. 

### 6. Dutifulness 
You are always creating at least one project. It is up to you to keep that project moving forward. This is why you're getting paid. This is why you are a creator at Integral. Your duty is to keep the project going. To ask for whatever you need in order to keep it moving: information, resource, tooling, insights, materials, content, knowledge, etc. Dutifulness means that you create results regularly and continuously and in a diligent fashion. 

### 7. Fun
We are here as a team of friends and equals. Nobody is above anybody else, no matter what their role or position is. Everyone can and will contribute in their own way and to the best of their ability. As such, we are going to do that through having as much fun as possible. We are not 'working' as such. Instead, we are creating, innovating and evolving things that are boring, outdated, broken into things that are fun, exciting, modern, contemporary, evolutionary and (wherever we can) revolutionary. This is how we Redesign Humanity. The future of humanity is fun, not oppression and work and struggle. 

### 8. Family 
At Integral, we co-create like a functional family. We are all helping each other to have as much fun and be as results oriented as possible. Communicate greatly, have respect and appreciation for each other, be productive and lead forward in the best way possible. This is how great family should be. 

### 9. Quality
We create the highest quality creations we possibly can in everything we do. Quality is more valued than quantity. We are always questioning how we can make something of higher quality than what we did previously. We are always looking to be the best in what we do. We get inspiration from the best we can find and then improve on it. 

### 10. Joy
We create with (en)joy(ment) in everything we do. We are not looking to create things we don't want to create. Within this, we recognise that even those things we love to do have an element of less enjoyable part to them. We make those elements as enjoyable for ourselves as possible either through automation or applying mixture of the other values, principles and approaches. 

## Integral design mantra and approach

### 0. Talk - is cheap
Avoid simply talking to others. One of the best ways to waste a lot of time is to talk endlessly about things. Instead of talking, we ought to focus on at least the next step (writing) things down. In a meeting with N people, each 5 minutes of talking are using up N*5 minutes of overall team's time. Meanwhile, no re-referencable artefact gets created, making it hard for other members of the team to remember what got discussed in the meeting.

### 1. Write - words create worlds 
Before we can create anything we need to write it into existence. The simplest way to write ideas down is to use [Super Simple Stories](https://github.com/flexewebs/Integral-White-Papers/blob/master/supersimplestories.md). More we focus on essence and core of the matters, the better. Words are commands which enable manifestation of the metaphysical into physical truth. 

### 2. Illustrate - picture says a thousand words
As soon as we write down what we want to create, we can start picturing, drawing or illustrating it. This is because human mind and brain is very well geared to recognise symbols and images. These symbols and images can tell different stories in different contexts. Symbolic and visual stories are much more impactful on people than written stories. 

### 3. Prototype - says a thousand pictures
Once we create pictures of core interaction points, we can link up those interaction points into a prototype that can be 'played' as a sequence of transitions and transactions. The prototype helps us much better understand what works and what doesn't as a more of a 'living thing'.  

### 4. Code - is truth
Whatever can be coded should be coded as soon as possible. Using atomic design principles outlined in the [Making Perfect Software](https://github.com/flexewebs/books/blob/main/MakingPerfectSoftware.md) we can bring the creation to even more life by codifying its intended behaviours into real world operating system.  

### 5. Release - is reality
Once the coded or prototyped creation we make gets seen by other people, it starts being truly tested. Sooner we bring our creation to the eyes of other people, the sooner we are going to know whether it really works or not. Releasing the creation into the 'wild' is the main way to ensure this testing gets done. Releases can be into the 'open' world, or can be more controlled to only selected group(s) of people to run smaller tests. 

### 6. Experience - is the product
The point of releasing our creation is to help create experiences in other people who are willing, able and want to use our creation. Experience is the product in the eyes, minds and bodies of our customers and users. Customers cannot experience something that has not been released yet. 

### 7. Transform(ation) - is the goal
Even though experience is the product, the ultimate goal of our creation is to impact on humanity (Redesign Humanity) and help create a better world out there for all people we can possibly effect with our creations. Design and creations are the ultimate drivers of worldwide transformation that lasts for a long time.
